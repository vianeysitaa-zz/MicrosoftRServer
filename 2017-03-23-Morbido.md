| post | Mórbido Xamarin App | Vianey Juárez Araujo | [@Vianeysitaa](https://twitter.com/VIANEYsitaa) | 2017-02-03 | Mobile Application Development with Xamarin | blue | Microsoft and Mórbido are working together to provide to their fans a new channel for horror an sci-fi movies through a Xamarin app that offers video streaming, podcast, news, and more. | English | Media and Entertainment |

# Solution Overview #

>Mórbido will offer podcast, streaming videos, news and different content for all of Mórbido fans through a Xamarin App that will be available for Android users.

## Key Technologies Used ##
*	Xamarin Froms
*	Visual Studio 2015
*	Media Services
*	SQL Server Azure
*	Azure Blob Storage
*	Azure Virtual Machines

## Core Project Team ##

*	Vianey Juarez Araujo (@VIANEYsitaa) – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft
*	Ricardo Pons (@RicardoPonsDev), Senior Developer, Mórbido 

## Customer Profile ##
>Mórbido is a multiplatform content generator. Started as a film festival but now their services extended to a website, TV network, a film distributor, a radio show, social media pages and a printed magazine.
Mórbido's content revolves around horror, sci-fi and fantasy and generates information on a daily basis, on all its platforms for over 5 million people from all over Latam.

>Mórbido URL: [Mórbido Web Page](http://www.morbidofest.com) 

## Problem statement ##
>“The constant and dynamic transformation of the entertainment industry, coupled with the insatiable interest of our fans to consume all kinds of content at all times, everywhere and in all possible devices and being our project a multiplatform generator of content and events throughout Latin America, led us to the conclusion that a mobile app was the only real option we had to concentrate everything, then we started  developing an application that had the capacity and strength to satisfy our current needs and allow us to continue growing.” (Pablo Guisa Koestinger, Mórbido CEO).

>Mórbido needed a mobile app because they have different audience channels, like the magazine, TV, movies, web page, social media, etc. and they need this app to gather all of this channels. With it they will start collecting all the information from their users (or as they call them, fans) because by now, they don’t have a way to know how many of them they have. With this information, they will be able to offer specific promotions, discounts, or advertise their users.

## Why Xamarin ##
>Mórbido decided to go for Xamarin because they are going to going to deliver this app for UWP, Android and iOS, so they wanted to take advantage of Xamarin multi platform capabilities, and reach most of the possible devices for their different fans. 
>Mórbido development team is familiar with UWP developing, so they already know XAML and C#. The learning curve for Xamarin was smaller than learning each native language for Android and iOS.


# Solution, steps and delivery #
## Areas of improvement ##

>Currently, Mórbido doesn’t have a way to count how many of their fans are cross-consuming their products. For example, they don’t have a way to know how many users who buy the magazine, also are viewing the TV channel. Through this app, Mórbido will have a way to know more about their fans and collect info about them.
>In a feature stage of the app, Mórbido plans to add metrics on it to measure how many time does a user spend on the app, the most visited section, the most watched content, etc.


## Challenges ##
>One of the challenges encountered while developing the app, was related to video and audio streaming. Mórbido uses Smooth Streaming protocol to deliver content. The URL of the video that we get is ".ismv", and the Xamarin native player is not compatible with it.
>Mórbido decided to use Smooth Streaming in the back-end because gives the possibility to change video resolution in real time depending on the internet connection speed of the client.
>The video streaming was overcome by playing video through Rox Xamarin Video. This component allows the app to progressively play video from Azure Media Services. Also, this player has play and pause controls. 
>To use this component, we need to install it from NuGet using the following command.

```shell
Install-Package Rox.Xamarin.Video
```
>Implement the player into the project is really simple. Once we get the video URL from the back-end web service, we just have to create a view to build the player. Then we just assign the URL by binding.

```xml
<ContentPage
    x:Class="MorbidoXamarinClient.Views.PlayerView"
    xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
    xmlns:roxv="clr-namespace_Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable"
    xmlns:core="clr-namespace:Octane.Xam.VideoPlayer;assembly=Octane.Xam.VideoPlayer">
    <ContentPage.Content>
        <roxv:VideoView AutoPlay="True" x:Name="player" ShowController="True" Source="{Binding VideoURL, Mode=TwoWay}"/>
    </ContentPage.Content>
</ContentPage>
```

>To play audio, we had to implement XamarinMediaManager component. In order to be able to play a podcast within the app, first we need to get the podcast URL. 

```csharp
var result = await podcastService.GetSmoothStreamingUriAsync(SelectedPodcast.Id,
cancelToke, loginService.CurrentToken.AccessToken);
```
>Once we get the URL, we need to add a specific format for Android (m3u8 format).

```csharp
(format=m3u8-aapl-v3)
```

>In this way, the player now can play the podcast. 
>The next step is to implement the device native player, and assign the audio file it will play.

```csharp
var implementation = new Plugin.MediaManager.MediaManagerImplementation();

MediaFile file = new MediaFile(uri, 
Plugin.MediaManager.Abstractions.Enums.MediaFileType.AudioUrl);

await implementation.AudioPlayer.Play(file);
```

>It is important to mention that all of the timing and playback indicators of the file being played must be carried manually in the ViewModel podcast.

>Another challenge that we found, was presenting the news, because we needed to show the image within the news text title, like shown in the image below.

>Currently, Xamarin built in row table look is an image next to a text or just plain text, so we needed to create our own. In order to make this implementation, we needed to add a Custome Layout and a Custome View

>Custome Layout
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   android:layout_width="fill_parent"

        android:src="@drawable/icon"
        android:layout_alignParentRight="true" />
</RelativeLayout >

```
>Custome View

```csharp

public class HomeScreenAdapter : BaseAdapter<TableItem> {
   List<TableItem> items;
   Activity context;
   public HomeScreenAdapter(Activity context, List<TableItem> items)
       : base()
   {
       this.context = context;
       this.items = items;
   }
   public override long GetItemId(int position)
   {
       return position;
   }
   public override TableItem this[int position]
   {
       get { return items[position]; }
   }
   public override int Count
   {
       get { return items.Count; }
   }
   public override View GetView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
   {
       var item = items[position];
       View view = convertView;
       if (view == null) // no view to re-use, create new
           view = context.LayoutInflater.Inflate(Resource.Layout.CustomView, null);
       view.FindViewById<TextView>(Resource.Id.Text1).Text = item.Heading;
       view.FindViewById<TextView>(Resource.Id.Text2).Text = item.SubHeading;
       view.FindViewById<ImageView>(Resource.Id.Image).SetImageResource(item.ImageResourceId);
       return view;
   }
}

```

## Code Snippets ##
>Mórbido app connects to the backend through HTTP requests. In order to make it secure, Mórbido implemented OAuth to be able to get the required info in JSON format, so then it could be deserialized and pass it to the app in a clear way.
>In the next code snippet, it is shown how this back-end call is made. The user token is sent within the service call, and in this way, be sure it is a secure request.

```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<HomeDashboard> GetAllHomeDashboardsAsync (CancellationTokenSource cancelToken, string token="")
{
    using (var client = new HttpClient())
    {
        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(token))
            client.SetDefaultHeaders(token);
        var petitionUrl = new StringBuilder(Providers.ProviderSettings.UrlService);
        petitionUrl.Append("tables/HomeDashboard");
        var response = await client.GetAsync(petitionUrl.ToString(), cancelToken.Token);
        var result = await response.Context.ReadAsStringAsync();
        return await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
        {
            return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<MorbidoXamarinClient.HomeDashboard>>(result);
        });
    }
}

```

> Mórbido app has a principal dashboard, which creates an HttpClient class that calls the cloud service to get the info to display. A cancellation token is assigned in case the call is cancelled, so the app doesn't have to wait until the service responds. When the method recieves the JSON response, we parse it to a class that can be used by the application. 

```csharp
public async Task<Ienumerable<HomeDashboard>> GetAllHomeDashboardsAsync(CancellationTokenSource cancelToken, string token="")
{
	using(var client = new HttpCllient())
	{
		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(token))
			client.SetDefaultHeaders(token);
		var petitionUrl = new StringBuilder(Provider.ProviderSettings.UrlService);
		petitionUrl.Append("tables/HomeDashboard");
		var response = await client.GetAsync(petitionUrl.ToSting(), cancelToken.Token);
		return await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
		{
			return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<MorbidoXamarinClient.Models.HomeDashboard>>(result);
		});
	}
}

``` 
>The resulting window looks like this
![alt tag](http://aminespinoza.com/ascend/MorbidoAscend/Dashboard.jpg | width=100)

>To get the podcast feed, it's a similar method, but here we need to get the podcasts by category.

```csharp
public async Task<Ienumerable<HomeDashboard>> GetAllHomeDashboardsAsync(CancellationTokenSource cancelToken, string token="")
{
	using(var client = new HttpCllient())
	{
		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(token))
			client.SetDefaultHeaders(token);
		var petitionUrl = new StringBuilder(Provider.ProviderSettings.UrlService);
		petitionUrl.Append("api/Podcast/GetPodcastByCategoryId");
		var response = await client.GetAsync(petitionUrl.ToSting(), cancelToken.Token);
		return await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
		{
			return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<MorbidoXamarinClient.Models.Podcast>>(result);
		});
	}
}

``` 
>The resulting window looks like this

![alt tag](http://aminespinoza.com/ascend/MorbidoAscend/PodcastFeed.jpg)

>To reproduce a selected podcast, we need to get the podcast url from the web service. In order to reproduce the content, we need to replace the mpd format to m3u8, then we put the player in stop mode (in case it's playing something before). In here we found out that the AudioPlayer doesn't allow you to play the same file more than once, so we had to put an alter url to play in the moddle, so finally we can play the audio from the service.

```csharp
private async void SelectedItemCommandExecute(object obj)
{
	IsBusy = true;
	try
	{
		if(obj!=null && obj is Infrastructure.Models.Podcast && !string.IsNullOrEmpty((obj as Infrastructure.Models.Podcast).Id))
		{
			SelectedPodcast.Duration = 100;
			IsAutoPlay = false;
			var result = await podcastService.GetSmoothStreamingUriAsync(SelectedPodcast.Id, cancelToken, loginService.currentToken.AccessToken);
			var url = Infrastructure.Helpers.GetLinksHelper.GetLinks(result);
			SelectedPodcast.PodcastUrl = url.FirstOrDefault();

			string uri = string.Empty();
			if(SelectedPodcast.PodcastUrl.Constrains("(format=mp-time-csf)")
			{
				uri = SelectedPodcast.PodcastUrl.Replace("(format=mpd-time-csf)", "(format=m3u8-aapl-v3)");
			}
			else if (!SelectedPodcast.PodcastUrl.Contains("(format=m3u8-aapl-v3)"))
			{
				uri = SelectedPodcast.PodcastUrl + "(format=m3u8-aapl-v3)";
			}

			await implementation.AudioPlayer.Stop();
			//for dispose player and change the current track
			MediaFile disposerFile = new Mediafile("www.urlinthemiddle.com", Plugin.MediaManager.Abstractions.Enums.MediaFileType.AudioUrl);
			await implementation.AudioPlayer.Play(disposerFile);

			await Task.Delay(1000);
			MediaFile file = new Mediafile(uri, Plugin.MEdiaManager.Abstraction.Enums.MediaFileType.AudioUrl);
			await implemetantion.AudioPlayer.Play(file);

			IsBusy = false;
			IsAutoPlay = true;
		}
	}
	catch (Exception exception){
		IsBusy = false;
		//Send an alert showing there was an error acquiring the url
		await userDialogService.AlertAsync("No se ha podido obtener la información, por favor verifica tu conexión a internet.", "Advertencia", "Aceptar");
	}
	IsBusy= false;
}

```

## Architecture Diagram ##

![alt tag](http://aminespinoza.com/ascend/MorbidoAscend/Architecture diagram.jpg)

## General Lessons ##
* It was really difficult to find information regarding to streaming integration with Xamarin. We expect this documentation can help other developers to solve this quickly.
* There were a lot of NuGet packages that we tried to implemet to do the Streaming. This packages crashed and closed the application while testing it. 

## Opportunities Going forward ##
>This application will 
>
>
>be launched in the second week of March for Android, and it is now in scope to launch the application for iOS and UWP later. They are going to use Xamarin for this apps, so they can reuse most of the functionality, and speed up the development phase for the other devices.
>Also, another opportunity is related to store metrics from users. In a future stage of the application, they are planning to collect metrics from the users on the app, so they can know how many time a user spend on each section, the most visited section, etc., and capitalize this information by targeting ads or showing content to users depending on the most visited sections (horror, sci-fi, etc).


## Conclusion ##
> The impact of this app is related to Mórbido fans, and Mórbido itself. Mórbido will start collecting information of their fans into a database, so they can know how many people they are reaching, the different countries they are from, and start offering more content. The fans will be impacted because they can watch Mórbido movies without a TV channel subscription, listen to the podcast and news related to the horror and sci-fi movies.
