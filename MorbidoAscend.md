Problem statement
“The constant and dynamic transformation of the entertainment industry, coupled with the insatiable interest of our fans to consume all kinds of content at all times, everywhere and in all possible devices and being our project a multiplatform generator of content and events throughout Latin America, led us to the conclusion that a mobile app was the only real option we had to concentrate everything, then we started  developing an application that had the capacity and strength to satisfy our current needs and allow us to continue growing.” (Pablo Guisa Koestinger, Mórbido CEO).
Mórbido needed a mobile app because they have different audience channels, like the magazine, TV, movies, web page, social media, etc. and they need this app to gather all of this channels. With it they will start collecting all the information from their users (or as they call them, fans) because by now, they don’t have a way to know how many of them they have. With this information, they will be able to offer specific promotions, discounts, or advertise their users.
